# SkillMapMentor

An app that takes in a resume and extracts keywords (skills) and then displays them. 

Working on setting up the ability to click into the keyword into the second level where it then generates keywords for the specific keyword. 

Then, you're able to click once more into a second level keyword (skill) then it will generate definitions, explanations, real world use cases, and training examples that can be documented to gain experience.
